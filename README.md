# Scout
_Scout is super alpha and worthless, move along..._

Scout will be a host recon tool, similiar to [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt). 

It's a project I'm using to help me learn Rust, so right now it doesn't do a whole lot and what it does, it doesn't do well. Since I'm using this to learn, I won't be accepting pull requests or issues, but you're welcome to fork this for your own purposes.
