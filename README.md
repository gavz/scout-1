# Scout
Scout is a host recon tool, similiar to [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt). 

It's a project I'm using to help me learn Rust, so right now it doesn't do a whole lot and what it does. Since I'm using this to learn, I'm only interested in pull requests or issues that address how I can do things better within Rust (not feature requests or bugs).
